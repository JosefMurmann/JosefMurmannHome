<h1>3D printing and design</h1>
<h3>3D printing is something ive been working with recently to rapid prototype designs. I have been teaching myself how to optimise my prints through the slicer software Cura. most of my 3d printing projects revolve around my interest in track cycling and how i could use the 3D printer to protoype components such as seatposts or handlebars.</h3>
