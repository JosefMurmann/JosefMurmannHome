<h1>Portable fax machine</h1>
<h3>Obviously this is not technically speaking a portiable fax machine in almost any way but that is where the concept began. I became frustrated having my phone on me at all times because I felt like i was becoming addicted to social media and the constant advertisement and dopamine burn out was frying my brain, I conceved of this device, that would simply recive a message and print it out using a recipt printer, thus removing any need to look at a screen but still receiving a message from friends.</h3>

<h3>After combining a Rasperry Pi with a recipt printer and a battery hat, I connected it to the internet through an ethernet cable to test it, I ran it throughh a web API called Ngrok which allowed me to recive SMS messages to a node.js server i was running on the Pi and then print the message. I wrote a program which translated images into Ascii text and printed them as you can see.</h3>

<h3>The final step was to use a 3g dongal for the internet connection to be wireless anywhere with signal, and to mount all the parts to a small base, the package is obviously cumbersome and not practical, but serves for a fun proof of concept as to what this type of comunication could be</h3>

<h3>having the physical recipts of the conversation is also a nice sort of semi physical mediam, and the printing of the messages is very exciting and novel. I think its unlikely to catch on but a cute idea to send printed messages to loved ones perhaps.</h3>
