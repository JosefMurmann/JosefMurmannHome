<h3>This is a primitive way of creating diffusion limited agrigation, the particals in this simulation skitter about randomly but do not in fact collide with one another. this makes their movement not dissimilar to brownian motion however without the effect of particals moving into areas with lower densities of particals. This means that the particals do diffuse, hence the patterns that would be expected from DLA, but as time progresses the process becomes slower.</h3>
